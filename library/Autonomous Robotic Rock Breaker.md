### Challenge

A rockbreaker is a machine designed to manipulate large rocks, including reducing large rocks into smaller rocks. They are typically used in the mining industry to remove oversize rocks that are too large or too hard to be reduced in size by a crusher. Rockbreakers consist of two major components, a hydraulic hammer (used to break rocks) and a boom (the arm). 

The challenge is to make a completely autonomous rock breaker control system. It must detect rocks, choose which rock to crush next, direct the hammer towards it at the desired angle, launch the hammer and determine the moment when to turn off the hammer and move on to the next rock.
