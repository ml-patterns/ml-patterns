### Challenge

The aircraft engine is the most expensive part of an aircraft, and also the most important in terms of the performance and safety of the plane overall. Therefore, inspecting the engine is one of the most important operations in aircraft maintenance. This inspection is carried out by specialized engineers, which adds the influence of the human factor, and is included in daily checks, C checks, and A checks. This operation can take 30 minutes or more, and is carried out daily, which costs a significant part of the budget in the year-round operation of a large aircraft fleet.

### Solution

A web service was made for automatic defect recognition of aircraft blades, giving recommendations for a service engineer. The solution allows you to upload photos via an Internet connection and perform all necessary calculations on a remote server, or make predictions on a local PC. A user-friendly web application has been created with a defect viewer, administrative functions, and automatic report generation. The solution allowed for reducing the influence of the human factor, and significantly reducing the time needed for inspecting aircraft blades. This reduces the cost of maintaining the aircraft, and most importantly â€” makes it safer.
