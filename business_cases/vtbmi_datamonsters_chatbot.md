### Objective

The VTB My Investments mobile application received the Runet award as the best investment application in the Russian segment of the Internet in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Due to the growing number of users, it was required to create a chatbot within the application for automatic consultations on the topic of personal investments.

### Solution
The virtual assistant has been implemented into the mobile app. It has been trained in brokerage terminology and can handle over 1500 different communication scenarios.

### Business effect
At the moment, the virtual assistant correctly processes more than 80% of requests, replacing a contact center with 50 to 100 operators. It conducts over 200,000 conversations every month.
