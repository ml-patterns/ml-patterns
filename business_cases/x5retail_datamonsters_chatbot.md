**Ð¡lient**: X5Retail

**Contractor**: Data Monsters

**Date**: November 2020

### Objective

It was necessary to automate the answers to legal questions of directors and store employees (for example: What if the inspectors came? What to do if the buyer broke his leg in the store?), since lawyers did not always respond quickly enough.

### Solution

Virtual assistant was implemented to automate legal support. It was trained over 100,000 specific product names and legal terms.

### Business effect
The solution was implemented in more than 20,000 stores and made it possible to automate the processing of 70% of requests from directors and other store employees.
