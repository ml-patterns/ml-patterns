**Ð¡lient**: Gazprom Neft

**Contractor**: Data Monsters

**Date**: February 2020

### Objective

The task was to automate the internal technical support on such issues as changing passwords, issuing sick leave and vacations, setting up access, and others. Before automation, these issues took several days to resolve.

### Solution
The virtual assistant has been implemented and configured to work in two modes: as a chat bot and an operator's prompter. The platform was integrated with the corporate ERP system (HPSM).

### Business effect
Now the virtual assistant processes more than 200 types of questions and reduces the processing time of requests from 2 to 10 times, depending on the type of request.
