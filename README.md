## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We invite you to participate in the compilation of open library of machine learning patterns, solution architectures and business cases.

Each page in the library consists of a description of a situation, its solution, and a large explanatory picture. The text is limited to 1000 characters. The key idea is to present information as briefly and clearly as possible - only the essence. [An example of a page](https://github.com/ml-patterns/ml-patterns/blob/main/business_cases/Defect%20Detection%20on%20Beverage%20Packaging%20Line.md).

## Contribution

For adding a new pattern, please use [template.md](https://github.com/ml-patterns/ml-patterns/blob/main/library/template.md) as a template, and raise an issue and later PR.
To request for improvement, change or question, please propose an issue.
